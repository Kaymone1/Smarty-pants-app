# Smarty-pants-app
My first class project using GitHub
# About Me
I developed 'Smarty-Pants,' a mobile dictionary application designed to provide users with a user-friendly and easily accessible vocabulary resource. This app offers thousands of words in a format that is simple and intuitive, catering to a broad range of users, including those less tech-savvy, such as my grandmother. 'Smarty-Pants' is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring that users can access the dictionary effortlessly on their smartphones and tablets, making it a practical and convenient language tool.

# Techniques used
The app is based off a dictionary API that gives me a very large array of words, meanings, phonetics, etc. info of a regular dictionary.
I used functions in Javascript to manipulate parsed information from my api "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>". In CSS, I used keyframes to create sliding effects in bringing in data for users in a semi-cool way. I used classes to organize data into different containers.
W3Schools and MDN was my obsessive reference for css and Javascript.

# Unsolved Mysteries
I couldn't figure out how to make the animations reset everytime the page loads new information with out refreshing the the tab. Also when I deployed on netlify my image doesnt show because of "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" code. I'm assuming I needed permission but I'm not sure how that works yet.
