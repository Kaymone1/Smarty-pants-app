# Smarty-pants-app
My first class project using GitHub
# About Me
This is my mini dictionary program called "Smarty-Pants" that provides users with a small handheld full of thousands words dictionary... THEIR PHONES! (or tablet anything that uses internet). This app gives users a dictionary that is simple and easy to read. Simplicity is important to broaden my target audience. I need my grandmother to find this easy to use!

# Techniques used
The app is based off a dictionary API that gives me a very large array of words, meanings, phonetics, etc. info of a regular dictionary.
I used functions in Javascript to manipulate parsed information from my api "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>". In CSS, I used keyframes to create sliding effects in bringing in data for users in a semi-cool way. I used classes to organize data into different containers.
W3Schools and MDN was my obsessive reference for css and Javascript.

# Unsolved Mysteries
I couldn't figure out how to make the animations reset everytime the page loads new information with out refreshing the the tab.
